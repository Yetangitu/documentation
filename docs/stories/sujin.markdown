We begin the Trovebox Stories seris with Sujin Headrick, our resident people person. You can <a href="http://sushi.trovebox.com">visit 
her Trovebox site here</a>.

**Trovebox: How did you find out about Trovebox?**

Sujin Headrick: I was a Kickstarter backer! Like a lot of folks, I had photos all over the web and on my hard drives. Deciding where to 
store my photos became a pain because no single [one] photo service was just right. One site had ridiculously long and not at all memorable URLs, another had tons of storage but an uncertain future, another had a history of not treating users' photos with care... the list went on. Couldn't a user have it all? With Trovebox (then called OpenPhoto), I could have it all along with a few extras like portability and control over where my photos are stored. Oh, and a little patience while the the site came into existence.

**Trovebox: As one of the first Trovebox users and supporters, how did you get involved beyond simply using the site?**

SH: I stayed in touch with the team, and around December 2011 Jaisen tweeted in search of a community manager. I had some spare time on 
my hands and wanted to get more involved in the project, so I sent an email and got started.

About a year later this volunteer position evolved into doing more for Trovebox, and here I am now! I've worked on just about every 
aspect of Trovebox and the Photo Project that doesn't involve code or design. You may have received tweets or answers to support emails from me or read some documentation that I penned.

**Trovebox: Tell us how you use Trovebox.**

SH: I want all my photos to stay safe in one place, not scattered across the web like they were before. To help this idea along, I store all my Trovebox photos in my personal Amazon S3 bucket, which gives my gallery room to grow. 

I also use the Trovebox Android app to share photos on the go (and yes, to Twitter). Some of these photos may be inconsequential, ranging from <a href="http://sushi.trovebox.com/p/115">a signed setlist</a> to <a href="http://sushi.trovebox.com/p/15l">a set of cupcakes</a>, but knowing everything is in one place gives me one thing not to worry about. Since everything is already in one place, the WordPress plugin lets me embed a photo in a post and save the trouble of uploading a photo twice.

**Trovebox: What kind of photography background do you have?**

SH: I don't have a background in photography at all, nor am I a great photographer. In fact, I don't even take that many pictures, 
which may come as a surprise. I just care a lot about keeping the precious few photos I do take.

**Trovebox: Any parting words?**

Sujin: My photos are happy that they're in one place, and I'm happy since I don't have to worry about it. Also, we want to hear from you! If you or someone you know is using Trovebox in an interesting way, your story could show up right here. Tell us your story at support@trovebox.com.
