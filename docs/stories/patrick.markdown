Patrick Santana is Trovebox's co-founder and mobile development lead. Let's get to know him a little better.

**Trovebox: How did you get involved with Trovebox?**
Patrick Santana: On June/2011 I saw an article in Techcrunch about OpenPhoto. It was a fantastic idea. I've been always struggled with uploading my personal photos to some websites. What do they do with my images? And I got much more worried when my son was born and we had a lot of private photos that we would like to share with family and just with family. I contacted Jaisen at the time saying that I had experience with Java but the project didn't use this technology, so I offered myself to help with anything that the project needed.  After the project was funded by Kickstarter I said it was time to have an iOS App and I learned and started to work on it. We had the first release on October/2011. Since then we've been updating and improving it.

Until January/2012 I was working in my free time as a contributor and in February I started to work full time on the project and as co-founder together with Jaisen.

**Trovebox: Tell us how you use Trovebox.**
PS: I love photos and I don't want to lose any of them, therefore my wife and I use the iOS App for syncing to the Trovebox using the Sync Functionality. Normally we upload as private. 

I also take a lot of photos with my DSLR. After I process all of them, I upload via the browser. I normally leave between 5-10 as public, the ones I consider the best pictures. All the rest are private.

**Trovebox: What kind of photography background do you have?**
PS: Amateur photography. I'm a computer engineer, normally no background in photography, some in digital image. I've been taking photos since MVC with floppy disk. I have to say that the number of photos increase so much after my son was born. I need to preserve his moments until he is grown up enough to do it himself.

And I am a Canon guy. :-)

**Trovebox: What’s your favorite Trovebox moment so far?**
PS: There are so many. I could say when the Kickstarter project was funded, when I started to work full time, the times I travelled to SF to work together with Jaisen (BTW, I'm living in Belgium). But from all of them, the most favorite one was when we got funded by the Shuttleworth Foundation.

**Trovebox: Anything else you’d like us to know?**
PS: Yes, I ask you to create an account, ask your family to create accounts and advocate us as much as you can. We are an open source project. Get involved via http://github.com/photo.
