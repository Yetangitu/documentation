Photo Sharing
=======================

## How do I share a photo?
You can share a photo by clicking the arrow button at the photo's page or in the gallery. This will show the options to share the photo.

## Where can I share a photo to?
Right now we support sharing via HTML embeds, email, Facebook, or Twitter. We want to add more sites, so let us know where you want to share your photos.

## How do I share a photo's link via HTML?
When viewing a photo, click the Share arrow and select the 'Embed in Blog' button. A box will appear with the HTML you can use to embed the photo in your blog, forums, or anywhere else. Copy this HTML, then paste it to wherever you'd like.

## How do I share a private photo or album?
You can share a private photo in the same way that you'd share a public photo or album. When you share a private item, a sharing token is added to the photo URL. The recipient can then use the full URL to view the photo without logging in or remembering a password.

## Wait, sharing tokens? How do those work?
A sharing token is a private URL that lets another person view a private photo. When you share a photo, a sharing token in the photo's URL enables other users to view your photo. Think of it as a password to a private photo, but in the URL. You can revoke a sharing token anytime in your settings.

## Can I share an album instead of a photo?
Yes. Click the Share button that appears when hovering over an album's summary, then share in the same way you'd share a photo.

## What happens when I share an album?
The album's URL contains a sharing token. The recipient will be able to see the album and the full contents of the album, even if those photos are private.

## What happens when I share an album with private photos?
The recipient will be able to see the album and the contents of the album, including any private photos.

## I changed my mind about sharing a photo or album.  How can I revoke its sharing token?
In the Sharing Tokens section of your settings, find the photo ID of the photo whose token you want to revoke. Click Revoke, and your sharing token will no longer work.
Don't know where the photo ID is? Look at the photo's URL. The URL looks like yourusername.trovebox.com/p/PhotoID, where PhotoID is the photo ID. The Photo ID does not include the sharing token in the URL.
