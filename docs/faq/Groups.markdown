# Groups and Administrators FAQ

## What are Groups?

Groups are a Trovebox feature that let multiple people upload photos to one Trovebox site. 

## Who can benefit from groups?

Groups are designed for anyone who wants or needs multiple users to manage their photo collection. Some examples include:

* ***Non-Profits***: We work with many non-profits that collect photos taken from different events. Most of the time one person serves as the main organizer by creating albums, while giving others access to upload to those albums (and therefore making the main organizer's life a lot easier).

* ***Businesses***: Businesses as small as five and as large as five thousand and beyond can benefit from Trovebox for business. If you have unique needs, chances are we can accomodate them easily. Contact us at <a href="mailto:support@trovebox.com">support@trovebox.com</a> if you have any questions.

## How do I get started with groups?

The Groups feature is available in your settings. All of Trovebox's current plans have access to Groups.

## What are Administrators?

Administrators are group members aside from the site owner who have full access to an account. They can do almost anything you can do, so choose your administrators wisely.

## Someone added me as a group member. How do I log in?

When someone adds you as a group member or administrator, you'll receive an email from us prompting you to set a password. Once you set a password you'll be able to log in through the website.

## How do I create a group?

In your settings area, click "Team Management" next to "General Settings". The "Manage Groups" area in this section lets you create a group, name it, add a description, and add members and albums.

## How do I add a member to a group?

Visit the group you'd like to add a member to. Click "Add members" and enter the email address of the member you'd like to add. They'll receive an email inviting them to set their own password.

## How do I delete a group?

Find the group you'd like to edit in the Manage Groups area and click its name. The Delete Group button is at the bottom right of the page in bright red. Click it to delete your group.

Accidentally clicked the Delete Group button? It happens to all of us. Click it again to undo your deletion and restore your group.

## How do I give group members access to albums?

In your settings, visit the group you’d like to add the member to. Enter the member’s email address. They’ll receive an email from us explaining how to set a password so they can log in.

## I'm a group member. How do I upload to an album?

While logged into your Trovebox site, select Upload and upload the photo(s) of your choice. In the Album area, you can select the album you'd like to upload the batch of photos into.

## What about Collaborators?

Collaborators have been renamed Administrators. When you add an administrator to a group, they'll receive an email with instructions on setting a password, just like a group member does.

## What if I have more questions?
