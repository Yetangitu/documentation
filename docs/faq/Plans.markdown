## What plans are available?
We offer a variety of plans for organizations of different sizes. You can view them on <a href="https://trovebox.com/plans">our Plans page</a>.

## Is a trial available?
Yes, each plan comes with a 14-day free trial.

## Do I have to select a plan when I sign up?

Nope. We'll alert you when your subscription is going to renew.

## What happens if my plan ends?
Don't panic! Nothing has been deleted. You can still access all your photos. You can also choose to resume using your current plan again.
