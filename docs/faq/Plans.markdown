# Trovebox Plans

## Is a trial available?
Yes, each plan comes with a 14-day free trial.

## Do I need to enter a credit card to use the free trial?
No. After your trial ends we’ll ask you for your credit card info so you can continue using Trovebox.

## Do you store users' credit card info?
No, we don't. Your credit card info doesn't go through our servers at all, instead traveling securely from your server to our payment processor's.

## Do I have to renew manually?
Nope. We'll alert you when your subscription is going to renew.

## What happens if my plan ends?
Don't panic! Nothing has been deleted. You can still access all your photos. You can also choose to resume using your current plan again.

## How do I cancel after my free trial?
Email us at <a href="mailto:support@trovebox.com">support@trovebox.com</a> and we’ll make sure your trial gets cancelled.

## What happens if I don’t continue to use Trovebox after the free trial?
Your Trovebox site will become read-only, so you won’t be able to upload or edit content.

## What happens if I run out of storage?
You'll need to upgrade your plan or delete content before uploading more photos.

## How do I change my plan?
Visit <a href="https://trovebox.com/me">your subscription page and click <em>Change</em> next to your plan info. You can change your plan to one of our other available plans.

## I need help selecting a plan. Can you help?
Sure. Email us at <a href="mailto:support@trovebox.com">support@trovebox.com</a> and we’ll talk with you through your needs.

## My business’s photo needs go far beyond what your plans currently provide. Can we make a customized plan?
Absolutely. Email us at <a href="mailto:support@trovebox.com">support@trovebox.com</a> and we’ll talk.

## I've heard that free and Pro accounts are no longer being offered. What does that mean for me?
As of 25 October 2013, new free and Unlimited Pro accounts are no longer available. Existing free and Pro accounts will continue to be honored. Pro accounts will continue to be renewed at the same $29.99 per year rate.

## What did Trovebox Pro account holders receive?
Pro account holders received:

* Unlimited photo uploads (Compare to 100 photos/month for free users)
* Import your photos from Flickr, Facebook, and Instagram.
* <a href="https://trovebox.com/migrate">Switch where you store your photos</a> as many times as you wish
* Give multiple users access on your account without giving them your password

These features are now available with our current plans.
