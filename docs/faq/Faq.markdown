Frequently Asked Questions
=======================

Here are some questions that people have about The OpenPhoto Project. If you have one that's not on this list send an <a href="mailto:openphoto@googlegroups.com">email</a>.

### What is OpenPhoto?
OpenPhoto is a photo hosting service that puts you in control. It lets you import, archive, and organize your photos on OpenPhoto's servers or your personal cloud accounts such as Dropbox or Amazon S3. Your choice.

It's the photo service you never knew you wanted until it existed.

### What makes OpenPhoto different than Flickr/Smugmug/Instagram/any other photo site?
Normally you pay one company to store your photos and to provide services to share them. This means that you can't do much if they raise their prices or shut down their site. If you decide you don't like their site anymore, the process of leaving and setting up somewhere new can be long and frustrating if you care about keeping your photos.

With OpenPhoto you can switch between services, use more than one at a time, or stop using the service without losing a single photo.
