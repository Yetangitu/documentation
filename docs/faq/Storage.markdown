Photo Storage
=======================

## Wait, I can choose not to store my photos with you?
Absolutely. This is so important to us that it's the very first thing we built into the site. If you don't want to bring your own storage account, that's okay too. You can connect a storage account anytime if you change your mind.

## Where can I store my photos?
Right now Trovebox supports Amazon S3, Box.com, Dropbox, CX.com, DreamHost DreamObjects, and the Internet Archive. You can also use our storage if you don't want to use your own.

## What if I don't choose my own storage provider upon signup?
Then your photos get stored in our own S3 bucket. You can change this anytime.

## How do I switch where my photos are stored?
Visit <a href="http://trovebox.com/migrate">the storage migration page</a> while logged in, select where you'd like your photos to go, and follow the instructions. Note that this is a <a href="https://trovebox.com/plans">Pro account option</a>.

## Can I link my account to an existing S3 bucket?
Not yet. This is a known bug.

## Can I upload my photos to Trovebox through Dropbox?
Yes. This has been an experimental feature for awhile, and we hope to make it available to everyone in the future. Get started at [http://openphotoapps.com](http://openphotoapps.com).

## Is there a limit to how many photos I can upload?
If you're a free user you can upload up to 100 photos per month. Pro account holders get unlimited uploads, though your storage provider may impose space limits. If you're using our storage then everything is unlimited for a Pro account.

## Is there a total storage limit at Trovebox?
No, but free users are limited to uploading 100 new photos per month. However, if you're using your own storage you might run into total limits from your storage provider, like if you fill up your Dropbox account.

## Can I automatically sync photos to Trovebox from an existing storage account?
Not yet. It's on our feature wishlist, though. For now you can run the importer of your choice again and it will ignore photos you've already imported.

## If I'm using the Internet Archive as my storage, does that mean all my photos have to be public?
Not on your Trovebox site! However, the Internet Archive offers free storage for the sake of the public. Right now you can mark a photo as private on your site and it'll show up as public in the archive for archiving purposes. 
We're working on this.

## Do I lose access to my photos after using a certain amount of space?
Nope. Your photos are yours, and you still have access to everything you've previously uploaded.

## Can I access my original photos?
Yes. You'll always have access to your original photos in the resolution you uploaded them in.
