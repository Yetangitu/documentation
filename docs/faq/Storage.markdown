Photo Storage
=======================

## Wait, I can choose not to store my photos with you?
Absolutely. This is so important to us that it's the very first thing we built into the site. If you don't want to bring your own storage account, that's okay too. You can connect a storage account anytime if you change your mind.

## Where can I store my photos?
Right now Trovebox supports Amazon S3, Box.com, Dropbox, CX.com, DreamHost DreamObjects, and the Internet Archive. You can also use our storage if you don't want to use your own.

## How do I switch where my photos are stored?
Visit <a href="http://trovebox.com/migrate">the storage migration page</a> while logged in, select where you'd like your photos to go, and follow the instructions.

## Can I link my account to an existing S3 bucket?
Not yet. This is a known bug.

## Can I upload my photos to Trovebox through Dropbox?
Yes. This has been an experimental feature for awhile, and we hope to make it available to everyone in the future. Get started at [http://openphotoapps.com](http://openphotoapps.com).

## Is there a limit to how many photos I can upload?
The limit is a total storage limit, not a limit to the number of photos. If you are an existing free user you can continue to upload up to 100 photos per month.

## Is there a total storage limit at Trovebox?
Your total storage is include in your plan. Silver, Gold, and Platinum plans come with 100GB, 500GB, and 1000GB of storage, respectively.

## Can I automatically sync photos to Trovebox from an existing storage account?
Not yet. It's on our feature wishlist, though. For now you can run the importer of your choice again and it will ignore photos you've already imported.

## If I'm using the Internet Archive as my storage, does that mean all my photos have to be public?
Not on your Trovebox site! However, the Internet Archive offers free storage for the sake of the public. Right now you can mark a photo as private on your site and it'll show up as public in the archive for archiving purposes. 
We're working on this.

## Do I lose access to my photos after using a certain amount of space?
Nope. Your photos are yours, and you still have access to everything you've previously uploaded.

## Can I access my original photos?
Yes. You'll always have access to your original photos in the resolution you uploaded them in.
