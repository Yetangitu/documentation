Account and Site Management
=======================

## How do I log in?
You can do this in two ways: through the main Trovebox site or through your own site. Click Sign In, and then enter the email address you signed up with and your password.

## How can I retrieve a lost password?
Go to the Sign In page and click "Forgot Password" next to the password entry field. Enter the email address you signed up with and click Submit. You'll receive a link where you can reset your password.

## Can I change the email I signed up with? 
Not at this time. You can always create another account under a separate email.

## Can I change my username?
Unfortunately no. You can always create a new account with your desired username. If you'd like your current account to be deleted so you can use the same email address again, email us at [support@trovebox.com](mailto:support@trovebox.com) and we can free your email address for you.

## Can I change my password?
Yes. When you sign in, click "Forgot password?" and enter your email address. You'll get a link to reset your password as if you had forgotten it.

## How does white-labeling at Trovebox work?
Email us at [support@trovebox.com](mailto:support@trovebox.com) with what you’d like modified on your Trovebox site, and we'll take care of it for you. Soon we’ll offer a way for you to do this yourself.

## How do I add a top level domain?
Adding a top level domain to your Trovebox site is currently all manual on our end, so there are two steps to take. First, email <a href="mailto:support@trovebox.com">support@trovebox.com</a> with the domain or subdomain you'd like to add to your Trovebox site.

After we've replied and confirmed that we've set up your domain, you'll need to create a CNAME record for your domain. This is a type of DNS resource record, so consult your domain registrar's documentation on where to set it. DNS settings are a good place to start. Enter the following where prompted:

* Name: your subdomain
* Type:	CNAME
* Data (or Alias):	yourusername.trovebox.com.

It'll take up to 24 hours for your changes to take effect.

## How do I add Twitter cards for my domain?
Twitter cards are added per domain over at Twitter. You can <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards">apply for them separately</a> for your own domain there.

## How do I delete my account?
We're sad to see you go. Right now account deletion is manual, so email [support@trovebox.com](mailto:support@trovebox.com) and we'll delete your account for you.
