Trovebox Collect
================

## Can I let anonymous users upload to my account?
Yes. The Invite Uploaders link in each album lets you invite others to upload photos to that album. Click “Invite Uploaders” and send the link to anyone you like.

## What is Trovebox Collect?
Trovebox Collect is a feature that makes collecting photos from others easier by letting them upload straight to one of your albums. It's as easy as sending an upload link to someone.

## How is Collect different from email attachments or Dropbox?
With email attachments, the sender has to find and attach each photo individually. When you receive the photos, you have to open and save each photo attachment one by one.

Another alternative is using a shared Dropbox folder. All the space in that folder counts toward each user’s quota, which is space not everyone has or wants to sacrifice.

Trovebox Collect lets you collect photos by simply sending a link.

## How does Trovebox Collect work for me, the site owner?
Visit the album you'd like someone to upload to and select "Invite Uploaders". Then share the link we generate with anyone you like. The recipients can then upload photos through the Trovebox Collect mobile app, their mobile browsers, or their computer. We notify you when someone has uploaded a photo.

## Can someone with an upload link upload photos from their computer?
Yes. When they visit the upload link from their computer they arrive at an upload page.

## Is the upload link usable indefinitely?
No. All upload links expire 14 days after you create them. You can revoke access anytime before then. You can also create a new upload link after the old one expires.

## How does Trovebox Collect work for someone uploading a photo?
When someone clicks a link we’ll direct them to the photo upload page, and they can select the photos to upload.

It’s easy, there’s no software to download, and your recipients don’t need a Trovebox account to get started.

## Is there a mobile app available to make uploading easier?
Yes. The Trovebox Collect app is available for Android. Your recipients can still upload photos whether or not they have the app installed.
